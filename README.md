# Journal Quotes | using Python

### Reason for the Application: 
I like to journal from time to time. I believe that it gives me time to be retrospective with my thoughts and helps me stay grounded. Howvever, the issue I stumble upon is trying to find the right quotes to reflect to. This is what sparked my idea to create something that would when prompted give me a random quote from different journaling topics. 

### Result:
I was able to create the project, however it was quiet the challange to research all of the components I was still having difficulty in. I was able to run the code successfully and have it understand two condition of `yes` statements. It also understood the `no` statenment which was a major issue was having it my code. I learned about the `import random` and used the `random.choice` to randonmly choose a quote everytime and user needed a new prompt. 

### Challenges: 
- Making the code work - it seemed to break all of the time on me and I found myself very much frustration at how close I was at getting the program to work 
- I think that there is a better way to loop through the quote and do it again towards the end. This is bug in the program that I am going to tackle next as I believe they are directly connected on how code runs smoothly. 
- The options for UPPER and lowercase in the code where the program can understand and reach the code as equals regardless of how the user types it in. 
### Improvements:


### Coding Journey Journal:
This initially took me about 2 hours to get it all up and running. I then spent most of the week really researching how to get different versions of the word `Yes` to be read by the code. I like how simple this project is just because I can myself using it from prompts I think it would be cool seeing this as a whole web app. This really also was a test in understanding how list work and how they can be very helpful in my code. I felt like compared to my first project this one encorporated a lot of the skills I have been learning for the last three weeks.
